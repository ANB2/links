Just a bunch of useful links

## Scala

### Serialization

* [jsonpickler](https://github.com/teigen/jsonpicklers/blob/master/src/test/scala/calendar/CalendarList.scala)

### Concurrency

* [Retry for futures](https://github.com/softprops/retry)

### Web / REST / General

* [Scalaj-http](https://github.com/scalaj/scalaj-http) - really simple REST API.  Although, the latest Spray-client has been vastly simplified as well.

* [REPL as a service](https://github.com/mergeconflict/consolation) - would be kick ass if integrated into Spark

### Build, Tooling

SBuild seems like a promising replacement for SBT.  Still Scala, but much much simpler, more like Scala version of Make.  With MVN dependency and ScalaTest support.

* [SBuild Example](https://github.com/lefou/domino/blob/master/SBuild.scala)
