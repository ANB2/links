## Scala

### Serialization

* [jsonpickler](https://github.com/teigen/jsonpicklers/blob/master/src/test/scala/calendar/CalendarList.scala)

### Build, Tooling

SBuild seems like a promising replacement for SBT.  Still Scala, but much much simpler, more like Scala version of Make.  With MVN dependency and ScalaTest support.
